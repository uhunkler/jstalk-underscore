# jstalk-underscore

An adoption of the [underscore](https://github.com/jashkenas/underscore) functional library which can be used in JSTalk projects for Sketch and Acorn.

How to use the functions you can refer to the excelent [underscore.js](http://underscorejs.org/) documentation - the JSTalk version should work the same way. If not please submit a bug.
